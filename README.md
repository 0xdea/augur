Augur is a blazing fast IDA Pro headless plugin that extracts strings and related pseudocode from a binary file.
It stores pseudocode of functions that reference strings in an organized directory tree.

## Features

* Blazing fast, headless user experience courtesy of IDA Pro 9.x and Binarly's idalib Rust bindings.
* Support for binary targets for any architecture implemented by IDA Pro's Hex-Rays decompiler.
* Decompilation feature based on the `decompile_to_file` API exported by [haruspex](https://github.com/0xdea/haruspex).
* Pseudocode of each function that references a specific string is stored in a separate directory.

## Installing

The easiest way to get the latest release is via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/augur):

1. Download, install, and configure IDA Pro (see <https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro>).
2. Install LLVM/Clang (see <https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html>).
3. On Linux/macOS, install as follows:
    ```sh
    export IDADIR=/path/to/ida # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo install augur
    ```
   On Windows, instead, use the following commands:
    ```powershell
    $env:LIBCLANG_PATH="\path\to\clang+llvm\bin"
    $env:PATH="\path\to\ida;$env:PATH"
    $env:IDADIR="\path\to\ida" # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo install augur
    ```

## Compiling

Alternatively, you can build from [source](https://github.com/0xdea/augur):

1. Download, install, and configure IDA Pro (see <https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro>).
2. Install LLVM/Clang (see <https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html>).
3. On Linux/macOS, compile as follows:
    ```sh
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/0xdea/augur
    cd augur
    export IDADIR=/path/to/ida # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo build --release
    ```
   On Windows, instead, use the following commands:
    ```powershell
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/0xdea/augur
    cd augur
    $env:LIBCLANG_PATH="\path\to\clang+llvm\bin"
    $env:PATH="\path\to\ida;$env:PATH"
    $env:IDADIR="\path\to\ida" # if not set, the build script will check common locations
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

1. Make sure IDA Pro is properly configured with a valid license.
2. Run as follows:
    ```sh
    augur <binary_file>
    ```
3. Find the extracted pseudocode of each decompiled function in the `binary_file.str` directory, organized by string:
    ```sh
    vim <binary_file>.str
    code <binary_file>.str
    ```

## Compatibility

* IDA Pro 9.0.241217 - Latest compatible: v0.2.3.
* IDA Pro 9.1.250226 - Latest compatible: v0.6.2.
* IDA Pro 9.2.250908 - Latest compatible: current version.

*Note: check [idalib](https://github.com/binarly-io/idalib) documentation for additional information.*

## Changelog

* [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## TODO

* Integrate with [oneiromancer](https://github.com/0xdea/oneiromancer).
* Allow users to choose to process string cross-references even if the decompiler is unavailable.
* Implement functionality similar to <https://github.com/joxeankoret/idamagicstrings>.
